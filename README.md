# Discord-Bot

I've developed a Discord bot tailored to help teams collaborate on tackling Leetcode questions together.
The main aim is to facilitate discussions around finding the best optimal approach for each problem.

# Future Implementation-

  1)fetching contest details and notifying users
  
  2)implementing a duel system between members
  
  3)providing optimal solution rather than taking up random solutions.
  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on the idea. Additionally, if you have any suggestions for new integrations or features to enhance the bot's utility, please feel free to share them.

Just to provide some context, the Leetcode solutions referenced are sourced from the GitHub repository of NeetCode, a YouTube channel.
Meanwhile, the Codeforces solutions are pulled from the GitHub repo of Waqar-107, which I stumbled upon during random searches. 
The questions themselves are obtained through the Leetcode API
